called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). It
is commonly used to treat depression and anxiety disorders.
Here are some important things to know about Lexapro:  - It
works by increasing the levels of serotonin in the brain,
which can improve mood and reduce anxiety. - It may take
several weeks for Lexapro to start working, so it's
important to be patient and continue taking it as
prescribed. - Common side effects of Lexapro include nausea,
headache, dizziness, and dry mouth. These side effects
usually go away on their own after a few days or weeks. -
Lexapro can interact with other medications, so it's
important to tell your doctor about all the medications you
are taking before starting Lexapro. - Lexapro is not
recommended for use in children under the age of 12. - If
you are pregnant or breastfeeding, talk to your doctor
before taking Lexapro, as it may not be safe for your baby.
