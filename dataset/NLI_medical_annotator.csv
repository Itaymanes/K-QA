Genital herpes is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) and is characterized by painful blisters or sores on or around the genitals, anus, or mouth. These sores can recur periodically and may be accompanied by flu- like symptoms such as fever and swollen lymph nodes. Genital herpes is highly contagious and can be transmitted through sexual contact, even when there are no visible symptoms. HPV, on the other hand, is caused by the human papillomavirus and can cause genital warts or abnormal cell growth in the cervix, anus, or throat. Some strains of HPV can also lead to certain types of cancer, including cervical cancer. HPV is also highly contagious and can be transmitted through sexual contact, including skin-to-skin contact. In summary, while both genital herpes and HPV are sexually transmitted infections that affect the genital area, they are caused by different viruses and have different symptoms and potential health consequences.
