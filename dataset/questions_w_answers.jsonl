{"Question":"And how does Genital herpes and HPV differ?","Free_form_answer":"HPV infections and genital herpes are sexually transmitted infections that are caused by different viruses and have distinct clinical presentations.\n\nGenital herpes is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). Both strains of herpes simplex virus, HSV-1 and HSV-2, can cause genital and oral herpes lesions. Genital herpes can manifest with fluid-filled blisters on or around the genitals that burst and develop into sores that typically resolve within 1-2 weeks. During the first infection, Swollen lymph nodes and flu-like symptoms may also be experienced.. Outbreaks of genital lesions can reoccur, as the virus never leaves the body after initial infection.\nMost infected individuals are asymptomatic or only experience mild symptoms. HSV is spread through vaginal, anal, or oral sex, and contact with the skin, saliva, or sores of a person who has the infection. Oral antiviral therapy can be used to treat patients with recurrent genital lesions to reduce the severity of symptoms and lower the risk of transmission to an uninfected sexual partner.\n\nA HPV infection is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). There are many different strains of HPV. Low-risk strains can cause warts on the skin or genitals, whereas high-risk strains of HPV are associated with an increased risk of several types of cancer, such as cervical, throat, mouth, anus and genital cancer. HPV is spread by vaginal, anal, or oral sex, and close skin-to-skin contact with someone who has the infection. Most people with HPV are unaware they have the infection as they never develop symptoms and the body's immune system is able to clear the virus.\n\nThere is no vaccine for herpes yet, but a HPV vaccine is available.","Must_have":["Genital herpes and HPV are sexually transmitted infections caused by different viruses.","A HPV infection is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV).","Genital herpes can manifest with fluid-filled blisters on or around the genitals that burst and develop into sores that typically resolve within 1-2 weeks.","Genital herpes is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV).","Low-risk strains of HPV can cause warts on the skin or genitals.","High-risk strains of HPV are associated with an increased risk of several types of cancer, such as cervical, throat, mouth, anus and genital cancer."],"Nice_to_have":["There are many different strains of HPV.","There is no vaccine yet for HSV-1.","There is no vaccine yet for HSV-2.","Oral antiviral therapy can be used to treat patients with recurrent genital lesions to reduce the severity of symptoms and lower the risk of transmission to an uninfected sexual partner.","Outbreaks of genital lesions can reoccur, as the herpes simplex virus never leaves the body after initial infection.","HSV is spread through vaginal, anal, or oral sex, and contact with the skin, saliva or sores of a person who has the infection.","Swollen lymph nodes and flu-like symptoms may also be experienced with genital herpes.","Most people with HPV are unaware they have the infection as they never develop symptoms and the body's immune system is able to clear the virus.","Both strains of herpes simplex virus, HSV-1 and HSV-2, can cause genital and oral lesions.","HPV is spread by vaginal, anal, or oral sex, and close skin-to-skin contact with someone who has the infection.","Most individuals infected with herpes simplex virus are asymptomatic or only experience mild symptoms."],"Sources":"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/std\/hpv\/stdfact-hpv.htm\n \n\n https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/std\/herpes\/stdfact-herpes-detailed.htm\n \n\n https:\/\/www.cancer.org\/cancer\/types\/cervical-cancer\/detection-diagnosis-staging\/cervical-cancer-screening-guidelines.html\n \n\n https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/std\/herpes\/stdfact-herpes.htm\n https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK448132\/\n https:\/\/www.cancer.gov\/about-cancer\/causes-prevention\/risk\/infectious-agents\/hpv-and-cancer\n \n\n https:\/\/www.msdmanuals.com\/professional\/infectious-diseases\/sexually-transmitted-infections-stis\/human-papillomavirus-hpv-infection?query=hpv#v1023807\n \n\n https:\/\/www.uptodate.com\/contents\/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection","ICD_10_diag":"Anogenital herpesviral infection, unspecified"}

If the pulse rate falls below 60 bpm, it is known as bradycardia (low pulse). Bradycardia can be a normal physiological response in healthy individuals during sleep, endurance athletes, and older patients. However, it can also be a symptom of an underlying disease such as obstructive sleep apnea, myocardial infarction, infectious diseases, central nervous system conditions, hypothermia, hypothyroidism, anorexia, and hypoxia. Certain drugs like calcium channel blockers, lithium, opioids, and beta blockers can also cause bradycardia. Once the underlying cause is treated or the causing drug is stopped, the bradycardia usually resolves.

{"Question":"What is sciatica","Free_form_answer":"Sciatica refers to pain that travels along the sciatic nerve path due to sciatic nerve injury or irritation. The most common cause of sciatica is compression of the sciatic nerve root by a herniated disc in the spine. Classically, the pain affects one side of the body and radiates from the buttock down the back of the leg to below the knee. The pain can be described as burning or stabbing and may be accompanied by paresthesia (tingling), numbness, or weakness. Symptoms may worsen with twisting, bending, sneezing, or coughing. It is typically diagnosed based on the characteristic pain and a physical examination. Diagnostic imaging studies may be recommended if symptoms persist for >6 weeks or weakness or numbness is experienced. The risk of developing sciatica can be reduced by maintaining good posture and healthy weight, regular exercise, muscle strengthening exercises, and proper lifting techniques. Mild sciatica usually resolves in a few weeks.
